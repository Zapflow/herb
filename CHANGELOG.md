# Change Log

## [v0.10.2-SNAPSHOT]

## [v0.10.1] - 2021-12-11
### Fixed
- Issue where somehow an invalid selector would be produced from munged
  function names, this fix ensures that there cannot be a selector with
  a hyphen+number, or number at the start of the selector. Will draft a new
  release when I've gotten to the bottom of this issue, currently unable to
  reproduce. See [issue #7](https://github.com/roosta/herb/issues/7).
- Hashing issue using fractional values [#9](https://github.com/roosta/herb/issues/9). Convert style object to string
  before calculating hash
  - `(= (hash 1) (hash 1.4)) => true`

## [v0.10.0]
### Changed
- The `:key` and `:group` meta data is now completely removed,
  deciding instead to "automatically key" all functions based on the
  computed style. This results in a bit different class/id where a
  hash is appended to the selector. This won't break anything but it
  does make the API much simpler. This also has the added benefit of
  improving grouping performance significantly.

### Added
- Add `:hint` meta data. Can be used to extend classname in case you
  need some more data to attached to classname. The hint is only used
  during development builds, by checking the `goog.DEBUG` flag. If
  you'd like to see the hint during advanced builds set `goog.DEBUG`
  to true in production compiler config.

  ```clojure
  (defn style []
    ^{:hint "my-hint"}
    {:color "red"})
  ```
  ```css

  .ns_function_my-hint_1234567 {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

## [v0.9.0]
### Breaking change
- This library from here on out only supports `cljs`
  environment. Previously most of the library was written in `cljc` to
  allow for easier testing, which made it possible to use Herb in
  regular Clojure environments. The functionality was severly limited
  and honestly I don't see much use for it. If you'd like to do some
  server side CSS rendering a much better option is simply using
  [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) directly.

### Changed
- By using the [macro sugar
  trick](https://blog.fikesfarm.com/posts/2016-03-01-clojurescript-macro-sugar.html)
  users no longer have to require macros via the usual methods like
  `:require-macros`, just require in the macros like any other
  function from `herb.core`
  ```clojure
  (ns my.namespace
    (:require [herb.core :refer [<class defgroup]]))
  ```

## [v0.8.2] - 2019-07-10
### Fixed
- Fixed issue in `<style` macro where `throw` would get the wrong number of arguments and error out.

### Changed
- Markedly improve performance when using large stylegroups
- Upgrade dependencies

## [v0.8.1] - 2019-05-13
### Changed
- Upgrade garden dependency to version 1.3.9
- Re-enable minification/pretty-printing

## [v0.8.0] - 2019-03-30
### Changed
- Updated dependencies
### Fixed
- Allow passing at-rules (at-media, at-supports ...) to defglobal
### Added
- New meta type `:combinators`, allows for targeting using garden selector
  combinators like `>`, `+`, `-`, `descendant` from `garden.selectors` namespace.

```clojure
(defn selector-test []
  ^{:combinators {[:> :div :span] {:margin-left "10px"
                                   :background "red"}
                  [:+ :p] {:background "purple"
                           :margin 0
                           :margin-left "20px"}
                  [:- :div] {:background "yellow"}
                  [:descendant :div] {:background "green"}}}
  {:background :blue
   :color :white})
```
Result:

```css

.herbdemo_examples_selector-test {
  background: blue;
  color: white;
}

.herbdemo_examples_selector-test > div > span {
  margin-left: 10px;
  background: red;
}

.herbdemo_examples_selector-test + p {
  background: purple;
  margin: 0;
  margin-left: 20px;
}

.herbdemo_examples_selector-test ~ div {
  background: yellow;
}

.herbdemo_examples_selector-test div {
  background: green;
}
```

The syntax is a map with a vector of variable length as a key, starting with whatever combinator function you want to run as a keyword. Some combinators takes multiple elements as arguments. After that put whatever style map you'd like to be applied.


## [v0.7.2] - 2019-01-01
### Changed
- Remove clojure tools.analyzer dependency
- Temporarily disable pretty printing due to a
  [bug](https://github.com/noprompt/garden/issues/168) affecting certain media
  queries.
- Remove debux-stubs dependency

## [v0.7.1] - 2018-12-28
### Changed
- Split out site as a separate project.
- Move examples to demo/examples

## [v0.7.0] - 2018-12-27
### Breaking change
- `:auto-prefix` in component meta is removed, instead use either global config
  via herb.core/init! or pass `:prefix true` and `:vendors` for a local override.
- `join-classes` is renamed to `join`

### Added
- New global `herb.core/init!` function defined and currently takes only
  `:vendors` and `:auto-prefix` as possible options
- Finish first draft of the tutorial page

### Changed
- Improve error handling, and use `clojure.spec` for various input validation
- `:auto-prefix` now accepts strings as well as keywords
- Add passing multiple elements in `defglobal` for a single rule:
  ```clojure
  (defglobal [:body :html {:margin 0}])
  ```

### Fixed
- Change how the `data-herb` attr is parsed, fixing issue with namespace slashes not matching fully qualified name

## [v0.6.0] - 2018-10-13
### Breaking change
- `global-style!` runtime function has been replaced by `defglobal` macro

### Changed
- Upgrade dependencies
- The herb data string is no longer used in production builds
- Data-string now more resemble the fully qualified name of input function
- Change project structure from multiple separate projects to a single project
- Disable CSS pretty printing on production builds

### Added
- @supports queries via `:supports` metadata
- @keyframes support via `defkeyframes` macro and accompanying `<keyframes` macro
- vendor prefixes via `:vendors` and `:auto-prefix` metadata
- defglobal macro that when used appends garden style vectors to head as CSS

## [v0.5.0] - 2018-06-17
### Added
- Clojure support
- `<style` macro that returns realized styles instead of a classname
- `defgroup` macro to wrap common pattern

### Changed
- Business logic now in `cljc` to simplify testing, using lein test instead of a javascript runner
- Rename `set-global-style!` to `global-style!`
- Rename `:mode` to `:pseudo`

## [v0.4.0] - 2018-03-31
### Fixed
- Issue with passing a keyword as a style key causing a crash

### Added
- New meta data `:id` that returns an id instead of a classname
- Add `set-global-style!` helper fn that assists setting styles to global elements like <a>, <body> and so forth
- Add `join-classes` helper fn that takes multiple class names and joins them.
- Setup `:advanced` build, using munged function names in-place of fully qualified names

### Changed
- Introduce two new macros `<class` and `<id` and deprecate `with-style`
- Changed identifier and data string to use input functions `.-name` field. This
  allows for nested forms.
- Include NS in anonymous function identifiers and data string to make them
  easier to debug
- Args are no longer used as a data string identifier, key is used instead since
  it would more likley conform to a readable identifier.

## [v0.3.5] - 2018-02-23
### Changed
A change in the :extend metadata syntax:
```clojure
;; Passing single function
^{:extend some-style-fn}

;; Passing fn with args
^{:extend [some-style-fn some-arg]}
